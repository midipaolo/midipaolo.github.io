I'm making a site for the CS/Tech Department at TSS

User Story: "As a student, I want a simple intro to the tech classes so that I can see if I would be interested in taking the classes or not."


Feature Backlog:
"Path to Mastery" Page
--Like an interactive checklist for technologies, frameworks, tools, etc. prioritized by Stack Overflow's survey.
----It should have a place to attach a document, folder, link, github repo (best), that provides an example of each skill. When there's a repo (or more) linked, it will check itself off the list and update some sort of progress bar.

"Ongoing Sprint" for each class.
--Shows countdown until Presentation Day.
--Shows all relevant  information.
--Includes Product & Feature Backlogs
----These should be editable.. like Canny, or like GitHub Issues?

"Wildly Successful"
--Examples of past work
--or examples of work done by high school students in other places

"Global Project Backlog"
--List of projects available for all classes to look at and choose from.
--Sortable and filterable.
