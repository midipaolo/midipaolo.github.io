    <h3>HR</h3>
    <a href="/pages/hr.html"><img src="/assets/hr-img.jpg" alt="Three people in a conference room" width="100%"></a>
    <p>Every major company has a Human Resources department. If you need someone to interview and hire new employees, it would be helpful if they could at least understand the terminology and concepts in the tech world. Therefore, HR workers that have some tech experience are highly sought-after.</p>

    <h3>UI/UX</h3>
    <a href="/pages/ui.html"><img src="/assets/ui-img.jpg" alt="Tablet with website design sketch" width="100%"></a>
    <p>There has never been a better time in history to make money as an artist. Every app and every website needs someone to design the aesthetic elements. User interface designers understand design principles, but they have an awareness of how apps work, so that their designs fit the medium in which they're displayed.</p>

    <h3>Project Manager</h3>
    <a href="/pages/pm.html"><img src="/assets/project-management-img.jpg" alt="Person planning with sticky notes" width="100%"></a>
    <p>Believe it or not, creating new features in apps is a very complect process, and it requires organized coordination of programmers, artists, sales, user experience designers, and others. In order to coordinate this work, companies often hire project managers to just make sure everything goes according to plan and remains on schedule. If you have a talent for organization and planning, you don't necessarily have to know how to code to work for a big tech company, earn a big salary, work remotely, and just organize the work of others.</p>
